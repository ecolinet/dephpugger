# Install

To install you must run this code (using the composer).

```sh
$ composer require tacnoman/dephpugger
```

# Dependencies

- PHP 7.0 or more (not tested in older versions)
- Xdebug activate

# Usage

To usage you must (after installation) run two binaries in `vendor/bin` folder.

```sh
$ php vendor/bin/debugger # Server running in port 8888
$ php vendor/bin/dbgp-client # Debugger waiting debug
```

You must run in two different tabs (in next version you'll can run in an uniq tab).
After run theese commands, you need to put the follow line in your code:

```php
<?php

# ...
xdebug_break(); # This code is a breakpoint like ipdb in Python and Byebug in Ruby
# ....
```

After this, you can open in your browser the page (localhost:8888/[yourPage.php]).
When you request this page your terminal will start in breakpoint (like a image 1.0).

## Comands after run

When you stop in a breakpoint you can make theese commands:
